# QA Arcade Robot

Automated test project using **Robot Framework** and **SeleniumLibrary**.
This repository is a learning environment and a portfolio project.


This project is based on the idea and scope of my **qa_arcade** project (Playwright + Pytest).
The goal is similar: clean structure, readable tests with DDT and BDT approach.

The main difference: this version is implemented in **Robot Framework + Selenium** instead of Playwright + Pytest.

## Current Features
- Robot Framework + Selenium for automation in Chrome
- Page layer in `resources/web/pages/` (locators and simple actions)
- Flow layer in `resources/web/App.resource` (high level keywords to keep tests readable, useful as the project grows and flows/navigation become more complex)
- Data driven tests with DataDriver (CSV matrix for Basic Auth)
- Automatic screenshot on failure (saved in test report)
- Reports generated by Robot Framework (log.html, report.html, output.xml)


## How to Run Tests

### 1. Set Up Virtual Environment

Windows (PowerShell)
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS / Linux
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Tests

Run all tests and generate reports in `results/`
```
robot -d results tests
```

Run a single file
```
robot -d results tests/web/checkboxes.robot
```

### 4. WebDriver note (Chrome)
This project does not store chromedriver in the repo.
Selenium 4 uses Selenium Manager, so the matching driver is downloaded automatically when needed.

## Reporting
Robot Framework generates:
- `results/log.html`
- `results/report.html`
- `results/output.xml`

When a test fails, a screenshot is captured automatically and attached in the report.

### About the `results/` folder
- The folder is created only when tests are executed.
- It is ignored by Git (not versioned) because it contains generated artifacts (reports, screenshots).
- To view a report, simply run the tests and open the generated HTML file in a browser.
